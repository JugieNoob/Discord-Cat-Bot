##  What is this :question:

This bot fetches the top 100 posts from [r/cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/) and randomly selects one of them to post in the specified channel. The posts are fetched using the Python library [praw](https://pypi.org/project/praw/) which allows the bot to easily fetch the posts.

If you encounter any problems with the bot please make an issue [here](https://github.com/JugieNoob/Discord-Cat-Bot/issues) and i will try my best to solve them.
